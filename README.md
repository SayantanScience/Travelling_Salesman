# Travelling_Salesman
A simulation of the famous Travelling Salesman Problem

Travelling salesman problem visualized,
You can give any number of points (if you are brave enough
To face the factorial time) and see the program visualize
The shortest path for you.

You may choose random points(which I did use most)
Or you can give your own points to it and it will still
Do the job
